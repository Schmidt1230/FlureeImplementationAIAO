# What has been done during June/July of 2024:

## Fluree

- The interns created a Fluree server on their local devices using the Fluree Server image from Docker Hub. The aia ontology has been converted from turtle format to JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data). JSON-LD is one of Fluree's most well documented notations to interact with a Fluree ledger and there is a lot of source material. We also found it easier to understand and read than the alternatives. 

## Postman

- We have created a Postman workspace to allow collaboration and coordination on handling HTTP requests to the Fluree Server. Postman allows you to enter the body and header section of an HTTP request. As well as easilly convert the request to other formats such as curl. 

## What needs to be done:
- The Fluree Server needs to be hosted in a manner which it can be accessed by mulitple devices. Possibly DigitalOcean. A Fluree Server image can easily be constructed using Docker and then simply add the aia ontology via the JSON-LD transactions in this Github repository. 
- Getting started with the Gold Standard Projects and create new entities and relationships for these documents.
